## A student loves to Learn New Things

#### I’m the Senior Director of Developer Advocacy at GitHub! Outside of that fancy title, I’m a startup advisor and investor, open source-er, and meme-maker on the internet. I enjoy building mechanical keyboards, playing music, hanging out with my family and friends, and teaching in my free time.
